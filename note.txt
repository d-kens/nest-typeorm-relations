TypeOrm Relations

1. One to One Relations 
 - This is an association where one entity is related to another entity exclusively.
 - This means that each row in one table corresponds to one and only row in another table. 
 - A one-to-one relation is established by using the @OneToOne decorator provided by TypeORM. One of the 
 entities in the relationship will need a @JoinColumn decorator which will indicate that this entity contains the foreign key.

2. One to Many or Many to One Relation
 a. One to Many Relation
    - One record in a table is associated with multiple records in another table
    - Example: Employee can have many Tasks
 b. Many to One 
    - Multiple records in a table are associated with a single record in another table.
    - Example: Many Tasks are assigned to one Employee
